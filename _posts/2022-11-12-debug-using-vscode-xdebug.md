The hassles of debugging with echo-exit, print r-exit, console.log(), and other debugging tactics that most of us use in our everyday work must be well known to PHP web application developers. Tools like Xdebug, which help us speed up the debugging process and save a tonne of time, greatly improve our productivity.

# How to Install XDEBUG 

To install x debug  with the latest php you can use 

  `  sudo apt install php-xdebug`

If you need to install Xdebug for specific version you can install by changing *.* with your version

   ` sudo apt install php*.*-xdebug`

*Example : sudo apt install php7.3-xdebug*

To check your php version  `php -v`



##### Next, open your Xdebug configuration file which should be on the following path:

`sudo gedit /etc/php/7.x/cli/conf.d/20-xdebug.ini
`

Once you open the configuration file, add the following:

     # xdebug v2.x
    xdebug.remote_enable=1
    xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1
    xdebug.remote_connect_back=1    # Not safe for production servers
    xdebug.remote_port=9000
    xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp
    xdebug.remote_mode=req
    xdebug.remote_autostart=true

    # xdebug v3.x
    xdebug.mode = debug
    xdebug.start_with_request = yes
    xdebug.client_port = 9003  //Your PHP installed port
    

Now restart your local server. On my server, it is apache so I restarted it using the following command.

`sudo service apache2 restart
`

Now make a local info.php anywhere in the server to check installed correctly

    <?php phpinfo();?>

## Integrate Xdebug with Visual Studio Code

Install  PHP Debug Extension By Felix Becker 

![image tooltip here](/assets/images/debug-extension-on-vsc.png)

After then  goto Run & Debug tab or use shortcut(Shift+Alt+F9)

![image tooltip here](/assets/images/debug-extension-on-vsc-setup.png)

and create a launch.json file  

![image tooltip here](/assets/images/debug-extension-on-vsc-setup-launch.png)

add the following code . We need to listen a port in which Xdebug is installed , thats all.

```json

                "-dxdebug.start_with_request=yes"
            ],
            "env": {
                "XDEBUG_MODE": "debug,develop",
                "XDEBUG_CONFIG": "client_port=${port}"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Launch Built-in web server",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "-dxdebug.mode=debug",
                "-dxdebug.start_with_request=yes",
                "-S",
                "localhost:0"

            "program": "",

                "uriFormat": "http://localhost:%s",
                "action": "openExternally"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
  
Now our program is ready for debugging. Run this script on you browser and VS Code should open at that breakpoint. Isnâ€™t this cool?!

Now if you see in VS Code there are 4 tabs on the left:

1. Variables
2. Watch
3. Call Stack
4. Breakpoints

If you expand Variables, you will see 3 variables of our script. You will see $res as uninitialised because our breakpoint line is not executed yet. Now we have total control on the program execution, line by line. You can execute one line by clicking on Step Over (or press F10). Step Over button is present on a menu above

Now start enjoying your hussle free debugging. 

VSCode is an awesome, free, open-source code editor that allows developers to debug anything. It is one of the most popular tools used by developers today and is extremely powerful and efficient. VSCode is a great choice for debugging code because it has a wide range of features that make it easy to find and fix errors. It also allows developers to step through code line by line, set breakpoints, and view the values of variables. Additionally, VSCode offers an integrated terminal, an integrated debugger, and an integrated source control system. This makes it easy for developers to get an overview of the codebase and quickly identify any problems. With VSCode, debugging code is a breeze, and developers can easily find and fix any issues they encounter.
